# Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet
In this project, Iâ€™ll be building my own reference cheat sheet to help me build more websites in the future. 
Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often 
my own notes and projects. So testing my current knowledge in HTML and CSS I made a table listing important 
kaywords in making a table.
